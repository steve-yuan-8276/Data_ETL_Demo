# Pi Day Challenge 

Every year in the United States, March 14, or 3/14, is Pi (π) Day! Pi is a mathematical constant represented by the Greek letter pi (π) that is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159.

Among many methods available to estimate pi, one is called the Monte Carlo simulation. This method helps solve problems by simulating randomness. The Monte Carlo simulation for pi is a probabilistic method used to estimate its value using random sampling. The technique leverages the relationship between a square and an inscribed quarter circle, calculating pi based on the proportion of randomly generated points that fall inside a circle.

The datasets for this challenge contain randomly generated coordinates for X and Y within a square. The scope is limited to 100 rows for each dataset. X and Y are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

Here, attempts were made using Tableau Prep and Alteryx respectively, of course using the same method.
